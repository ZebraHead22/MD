# About repository

There are many python files for various tasks deal with molecular simulating data processing.

## DataProc
Here a small program has been created with an interface for batch processing of files and plotting the dependence of the spectral density of oscillations of the electric dipole moment on the amplitude of the external electric field.


## Distances_Wordom
This folder contains code for quickly processing molecular dynamics simulation files, particularly for calculating distances between atoms or molecules using a console program Wordom for Linux.


## Fourier_Program
Here are two implementations of programs for constructing the amplitude implementation and constructing the spectrum of oscillations of the electric dipole moment.

## phazeMod
This program allows you to visualize complex harmonic vibrations, as well as build spectra.


## Processing
This folder contains a set of programs for operational data processing, in particular the construction of single graphs of various contents.
